## II. Progressive Training Program

### 1. Speed Development
*Morning Sessions (20 minutes)*
- Shadowboxing with light weights (1-2 lbs)
- Explosive push-ups: Progress from 9 to 19 reps per set over 8 weeks
- Speed bag work (if available)
- Reaction drills

### 2. Power Training
*Evening Sessions (30 minutes)*
- Circuit training:
  - Push-ups: Follow 8-week progression
  - Bodyweight squats: Start with 36 reps
  - Pull-ups: Begin with assisted, progress to unassisted
  - Core work: Hanging leg raises

### 3. Technical Training
*Afternoon Sessions (45 minutes)*
- Defensive stance practice
- Footwork drills
- Block-counter combinations
- Form practice

## III. Intensity Guidelines

Based on computational analysis, follow these training zones:

Speed Work: 90-95% of max effort
Power Training: 80-85% of max effort
Endurance Work: 60-70% of max effort
Technical Practice: 70-75% of max effort


## IV. Nutrition Requirements

For optimal muscle development and recovery:
- Daily protein intake: 76.8g - 105.6g
- Pre-workout meal: 2 hours before training
- Post-workout nutrition: Within 30 minutes

## V. Advanced Techniques

### 1. Two-Finger Push-Up Progression
- Week 1-2: Regular push-ups
- Week 3-4: Diamond push-ups
- Week 5-6: Three-finger push-ups
- Week 7-8: Two-finger push-ups

### 2. Speed Enhancement Drills
- Plyometric exercises
- Ladder drills
- Quick footwork patterns
- Reaction training

### 3. Defensive Mastery
- Center line protection
- Optimal stance width: 89.3cm (based on your height)
- Weight distribution: 60% back leg, 40% front leg
- Guard position maintaining centerline protection

## VI. Body Mechanics Optimization

Based on your measurements:
- Power Generation Ratio: 1.74
- Stability Index: 57.6%
- Mobility Factor: 83.3%

### Optimal Angles:
- Front Knee Bend: 15-25 degrees
- Back Knee Bend: 25-35 degrees
- Hip Rotation: 15-30 degrees
- Torso Angle: 5-15 degrees forward lean

## VII. Recovery and Progression

### Rest Periods:
- Speed Training: 30 seconds between sets
- Power Training: 90 seconds between sets
- Endurance Training: 60 seconds between sets

### Weekly Progress Markers:
1. Weeks 1-2: Master basic forms and techniques
2. Weeks 3-4: Increase speed training intensity by 20%
3. Weeks 5-6: Introduce complex combinations
4. Weeks 7-8: Achieve peak performance targets

> *Important Note*: This program is designed to be progressive. Do not skip stages or rush progress. Focus on perfect form before increasing intensity or complexity.

## VIII. Daily Practice Schedule

*Morning Session (6:00-7:00 AM)*
- 10 min warm-up
- 15 min speed drills
- 5 min cool-down

*Evening Session (5:00-6:00 PM)*
- 10 min warm-up
- 25 min strength exercises
- 5 min cool-down

Remember to maintain proper form and alignment throughout all exercises. Progress gradually and listen to your body to prevent injury while developing Bruce Lee-inspired capabilities.
